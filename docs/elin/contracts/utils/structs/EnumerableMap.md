# EnumerableMap

_Library for managing an enumerable variant of Solidity&#39;s https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#mapping-types[`mapping`] type. Maps have the following properties: - Entries are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time (O(1)). - Entries are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering. `contract Example { // Add the library methods using EnumerableMap for EnumerableMap.UintToAddressMap; // Declare a set state variable EnumerableMap.UintToAddressMap private myMap; }` The following map types are supported: - `uint256 -&gt; address` (`UintToAddressMap`) since v3.0.0 - `address -&gt; uint256` (`AddressToUintMap`) since v4.6.0 - `bytes32 -&gt; bytes32` (`Bytes32ToBytes32`) since v4.6.0 - `uint256 -&gt; uint256` (`UintToUintMap`) since v4.7.0 - `bytes32 -&gt; uint256` (`Bytes32ToUintMap`) since v4.7.0 [WARNING] ==== Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure unusable. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info. In order to clean an EnumerableMap, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an array of EnumerableMap. ====_
